## Stages of sleep

When we sleep, we go through a cycle of sleep phases.

1. Light sleep

2. Deep sleep

3. Dream state or REM sleep



These repeat cycles multiple times during the night.

## How much should we sleep then ?

A sleep cycle is 90 minutes. 
We should aim for an average of 5 cycles per night.

A small example. 
I go to bed at 1 AM.


```{r}
bedtime <- 1
print(paste(" Bedtime : ", bedtime, "AM"))
sleep <- 1+5*1.5
print(paste("Best time to wake up is: " , sleep))
```
